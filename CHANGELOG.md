###DynamicSurroundings-1.11.2-3.2.1.2
**What's New!**
* Added keybinding to toggle the block selection box on and off.  The selection box is the black fence you see outlining a block in the world when you have the cursor on it.  By default control is bound to the B key.

**Fixes**
* Rearranged some code to improve mod compatibility "out of the box".
* Don't allow AIR to be overwritten in the Acoustic registry.  This is what was causing the "iron block" sound when walking on the edge of a block.
* There were some reports of weather occurring underground in other places where it shouldn't.  I changed the implementation of suspect area of code. If anyone sees the problem file an issue and we can go from there.

###DynamicSurroundings-1.11.2-3.2.1.1

**Fixes**
