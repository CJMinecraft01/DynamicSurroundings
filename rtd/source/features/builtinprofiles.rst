Built-In Profiles
=================
Over the time Dynamic Surroundings has been published players have been asking how to accomplish
some things by tweaking the configuration files.  Some of these tweaks are pretty straight forward,
such as changing a configuration parameter in the ``dsurround.cfg`` file.  However, some of these
tweaks are more complicated and involved making an :ref:`external configuration Json file <tutorial-config-files>`.

To make things easier I have made some pre-built configuration files that are kept internally in
the JAR.  These profiles can be activated/deactivated in the "Built-In Profiles" configuration
screen.  The following profiles are provided.

..	list-table::
	:align: center
	:widths: auto
   	:header-rows: 1

	*	- Option
		- Description
		
	*	- Auroras in all Biomes
		- Enables auroras for all biomes
	*	- No Dust Effects
		- Turns off dust effects for all biomes
	*	- No Nether Weather
		- Disable weather effects in the Nether
		
Additional profiles will be added over time based on player demand.
