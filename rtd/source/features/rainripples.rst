============

When it rains, any rain splash on liquid will generate a water ripple instead.  The texture used for
the rain ripple is configurable:

- Original.  The texture as seen in the capture above.
- Circle.  Similar to Original but darker in color.
- Square.  Takes on a blocky form that fits within the Minecraft square paradigm.

As you can see above a squid decided to photobomb the screen capture.
