Welcome
-------
Dynamic Surroundings is a Minecraft Forge mod that alters the player's **visual** and **audible**
experience without changing game mechanics.  The player has a high degree of control over their
experience, and modpack authors can customize biome and block effects based on their need.

This set of documentation applies to Dynamic Surroundings v3.5+ for Minecraft 1.12.2+.
Documentation for prior versions can be found here_.

The design of Dynamic Surroundings permits it to run on a client without having the mod installed on
the server.  However, there will be limitations:

- Player speech bubbles will not be displayed.
- Village biome sounds will not play.
- Weather render effects will not be coordinated across clients.
- Battle Music will be limited (if configured)

Downloads can be found on CurseForge_.
